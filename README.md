## General Descriptions:
- Atomic Design is used for creating the components.
    --components
        --atoms
        --molecules
        --organisms
        --pages
- For Styling Scss is used. All the components are customized, no external library is used to make any components or functionality.
- For common functions and custom hooks. Please refer utils folder.
- For State Management Apollo Client with GraphQL is used. Also it consumes rest APIs not GraphQL Queries from backend.
- The codebase is also equipped with locale support. (for the same react-intl is been used.)
- Here you can also see a basic setup of eslint which restricts the whole codebase with a single structure and rules to be followed.
